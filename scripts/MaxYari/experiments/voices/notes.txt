NordFCombatDowntime1 - too complex? "Elf and" sound like an "elephant"
NordFCombatDowntime4 - too complex?
NordFMercyDisarm5 - sounds too insulted/doesnt fit the context
NordFRetreat3 - "Allies to me" probably doesnt make much sense when character is running for their life
NordFMercyDisengage4 - probably pushing it too far for a person who just surrendered
