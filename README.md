# OpenMW Experimental Mods
Experimental mods for OpenMW, quite often made to test the latest OpenMW developmental features. Most of these mods are made to test specific OpenMW merge requests or branches and will not work without them.

## How to install
- Place the contents of this repository into your ".../Morrowind/Data Files" folder.
- After that enable the .omwscript file in "Content Files" tab of the launcher. Since this is a collection of mods - there will be multiple .omwscript files, I'm assuming you already know which mod you want to try/test. Enabling all of them at the same time might break something... or not.

Have fun!

### Looking for ReAnimation or Mercy?

Looking for mods that were previously here? They got mature enough to move to dwellings of their own:

[Mercy: Combat AI Overhaul](https://github.com/MaxYari/OpenMWMercyCAO)
[ReAnimations first-person v2: Rogue](https://github.com/MaxYari/OpenMWReAnimation)
