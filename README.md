# OpenMWExperimentalMods
Experimental mods for OpenMW, quite often made to test the latest OpenMW developmental features.

## How to install
- Copy the "MaxYari" folder into your ".../Morrowind/Data Files/scripts/" folder. If "scripts" folder doesnt exist - create one.
- Register the "MaxYari/Experiments" folder in your data directories. The most user-friendly way to do that is via OpenMW launcher "Data Directories" tab. Use "Append" button there.
- After that enable the .omwscript file in "Content Files" tab of the launcher. Since this is a collection of mods - there will be multiple .omwscript files, I'm assuming you already know which mod you want to try/test. Enabling all of them at the same time might break something... or not.

Have fun!
