## Lantern config is a list of objects, inside of which "name" will attempt a partial match against a lantern id and model name, if much secceeds - this config is used for a lantern
## "offset" is a local position of a lantern pivot, i.e a point around which the lantern will swing
## "localSwingDirection" is a local vector used for signs to lock their swing direction to a single axis
## "onlyHangs" signifies that this lantern/sign is always hanging in game (i.e there are no cases where it will be standing on a surface and therefore should not be animated)
## if it's true - surface-detection raycast is omitted for this lantern. If you are not sure if the lantern always hangs or not - leave this flag at false, the mod is optimized
## enough to crunch through any amount of lanterns and verify if they are hanging or not.
## "avoidYawRotation" prevents the lantern from spinning aroun its vertical axis - similarly to "localSwingDirection" - useful for signs.
##
## If you want to introduce a config for lanterns in your own mod - please do not edit this file, instead supply "scripts/MaxYari/animated_lanterns/configs/your_mod_name.yaml"
## with your mod. Note that .yaml file name does not matter, this mod will pick them all up automatically, you only need to ensure that the name is unique and will not match potential
## lantern config file names from other mods.
##
## Additionally if you want to edit config and quickly verify change in game - use in-game console (tilda key) to run a "reloadlua" - this will reload all your active
## lua mods, including this one and its config.
## 
## Have fun!
