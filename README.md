# OpenMWExperimentalMods
Experimental mods for OpenMW, quite often made to test the latest OpenMW developmental features.

## How to install
- Copy the "Data Files" folder into your ".../Morrowind" folder.
- Register the "Data Files/scripts/MaxYari/Experiments" folder in your data directories. The most user-friendly way to do that is via OpenMW launcher "Data Directories" tab. Use "Append" button there.
- After that enable the .omwscript file in "Content Files" tab of the launcher. Since this is a collection of mods - there will be multiple .omwscript files, I'm assuming you already know which mod you want to try/test. Enabling all of them at the same time might break something... or not.

Have fun!

## Mods

### PhysicsInteractions

A mod for testing an experimental OpenMW physics branch. 
Grab and drag objects around by holding X in a similar (but not as granular) fashion to Oblivion/Skyrim. Press LMB while holding an object to throw it. Thrown items can damage NPCs. The damage and the throw strength are dependent on your strength stat.

### PlayerMovement

A mod for testing new actor movement lua bindings. Press jump in the air to air-dash.

### GothicCombat

A mod for testing new actor hit lua bindings. Every woosh hit now does a tiny amount of damage instead of completely missing the target. Copy Data Files from this repo into you game directory. Blood VFX courtesy of Shadow_Mimicry.
