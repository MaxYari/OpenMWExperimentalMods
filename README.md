# OpenMW Experimental Mods
Experimental mods for OpenMW, quite often made to test the latest OpenMW developmental features.

## How to install
- Place the contents of this repository into your ".../Morrowind/Data Files" folder.
- After that enable the .omwscript file in "Content Files" tab of the launcher. Since this is a collection of mods - there will be multiple .omwscript files, I'm assuming you already know which mod you want to try/test. Enabling all of them at the same time might break something... or not.

If you don't see the .omwscript file you are looking for - in the launcher - probably I haven't moved it outside the scripts folder yet. You have to register my scripts folder in your Data Directorieslike this:
![Data directories](/imgs/datadirectories.png)


Have fun!

## Mods

### Looking for ReAnimation or Mercy?

Looking for mods that were previously here? They got mature enough to move to dwellings of their own:

[Mercy: Combat AI Overhaul](https://github.com/MaxYari/OpenMWMercyCAO)
[ReAnimations first-person v2: Rogue](https://github.com/MaxYari/OpenMWReAnimation)


### PhysicsInteractions

A mod for testing an experimental OpenMW physics branch. 
Grab and drag objects around by holding X in a similar (but not as granular) fashion to Oblivion/Skyrim. Press LMB while holding an object to throw it. Thrown items can damage NPCs. The damage and the throw strength are dependent on your strength stat.

### PlayerMovement

A mod for testing new actor movement lua bindings, also an experimental branch. Press jump in the air to air-dash.
